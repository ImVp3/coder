ANALYSIS_TEMPlATE = """
    You are an expert code analyst. Analyze the following Python code and provide a structured summary
    that will be useful for generating unit tests. Identify:
    1.  Main functions and classes.
    2.  For each function/method:
        - Its purpose or a brief description.
        - Input parameters (name and type if inferable).
        - Return type (if inferable).
        - Key logic branches or behaviors.
        - Potential edge cases or interesting scenarios to test.
    3.  Any global variables or external dependencies that might affect testing.

    Respond in a JSON format with the following structure:
    {
    "summary": "Overall summary of the code's purpose.",
